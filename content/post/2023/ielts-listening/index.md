## Introduction

As monolinguals, we face a lot of difficulties in IELTS.

English is not solid （基础差）

Not familiar with IELTS （不懂考点）

Don't want to pay just want to escape（不想努力）

Therefore, we can improve listening from the following there aspects.

## English basis

First, vocabulary is required. Then need to the spelling and pronunciation of each word.

2 What's on the IELTS listening?
Difficulties in Listening

> 1. trap choice (陷阱选项)
>
> 2. The negation appears inaudible （听不到）
>
> 3. Don't understand the original text （不懂内容）
>
> 4. There is no detection of stealing the subject （没注意替换）

In general, this is considered as follows

- Words can be read and write
- Words can distinguish pronunciation and meaning
- Sentences can be read and translated
- Understand logical relationships
- Be familiar with substitutions and rephrasing
- Be clear about the test format
- Carefully prejudge the topic

> I think reading and writing words is the foundation, logical relationships and substitutions are key. (单词是基础，逻辑关系和替换是关键)

## How to practice listening efficiency?

First of all, there are four types of IELTS listening questions. They are fill-in-the-blank, map, matching, single-choice, and multiple-choice. There are tips and considerations for each type of question.

### Fill-in-the-blank

Steps:

1. Look at the word limit （看题目单词限制）
2. Circle the positioning words in the order of question number （划定位词）
3. Circled words can be pronounced （知道被圈词的发音）
4. Predict the content of the blank by circling （预测要填空的词）
5. Write the blank considering whether it is plural or not （判断填空词的复数形式）

> the positioning word are usually the first and after two
>
> - More stable: number, noun, proper noun
>
> - Unstable: adjective, verb
>
> - Trap: adjective, common antonyms, negative words

### Map

Steps:

1. Mark directions (such as top, bottom, left and right, or east, west, north and south) （标记方位）
2. Circle all the place names and know the pronunciation （圈出地名并知道发音）
3. Mark the picture in the order of question number （按顺序标记问题）
4. If the topic stem is in lowercase, it may not be directly addressable （如果题目是小写，可能发送改写）
5. Pay attention to the logical relation link words and answer （注意逻辑关系词）

Sometimes there will be a fill-in-the-blank-map, the method is also applicable.

### Matching

Steps:

1. Find the positioning words in the choices (not repeated and non-specific words) （找定位词）
2. Pay attention to logical relationships （注意逻辑关系）

> However, we should be paid to logical relation words and synonymous substitutions

Logical relation

- Paralleling

  `and, also, as well as, then, another, anything else? is that all?`

- Comparison

  `at the same time`

- Order

  `firstly, then, after that, lastly, and finally`

- Explanation

  `I mean, this means, in other words, for instance`

- Examples

  `such as, like, for example`

- Turn

  `but, however, all of a sudden, whereas`

- Cause and Effect

  `because, since, so, therefore`

- Emphasis

  `in fact, actually, especially, do + (verb), of course, important`

- Parenthesis

  `let me see, you know...`

- New Topic

  `now, anyway`

- Supplement

  `Oh, hang on, wait a minute`

**Synonymous substitutions**

Short rephrased

- Change the property of the word

  `reduce = reduction`

- Synonyms

  `reduce = fail = dive - go down = decrease = decline`

- Similar words

  `assignment = presentation = essay = reflect (paper)`

  `hash brown = chips = french fries = potato (food)`

- Explain

  `buying things = shop`

- Double negatives

  `not good = bad`

- Pronoun substitution

  `James = he`

- Context

  `first = succeed`

Invert

  `Tom's books = the books of Tom`

  `priority for revision = revision priority`

Long rephrased

- A = B

- Passive = Active

### single-choice & multiple-choice

Steps:

- Read and mark the question （优先看完问题，审题）

- Underline test points, pay attention to substitution, Know the pronunciation （**考点划线**，注意**改写**，生词猜发音）

- Make notes when listening （边听边做记号）

Tips

> 1. Three major positioning methods
>
> 2. Don't understand + choice original word = trap
>
> 3. It's safer to hear rewrites
>
> 4. Pay attention to the juxtaposition of options
>
> 5. Pay attention to the identity and gender of the person speaking

Focus on positioning

> 1. The original word in the question
>
> 2. Logical connectives
>
> 3. Rephrase the question

## Summary

- Try to look at all the choices （题目选项尽量都看）

- Look and draw a circle （边看边画圈预判）

- Look at each section in order of question number （每个部分按题号顺序看）

- Notice the timing （注意时间）

- The third part is most difficult to recommend squeezing in time to see in advance （第三部分最难建议挤时间提前看）
