## Introduction

Not like CET-4 or CET-6, IELTS reading required efficiency. So you needn't read the full text. Another feature is that the difficulty of IELTS reading is not increasing, which means you can't finish the task in order. **Look at the title first, then look at the question, and choose the easy one to finish.**

## TRUE & FALSE, NOT GIVEN

Before starting the exercise, we should know two keys in IELTS reading: positing words and pointing words. (定位词和考点词)

### positioning words

the posting words can determine the location of the answer. So we should do the questions according to the test site, rather than guess.

Common positioning words

1. Numbers (temperature, time, percentage) Capital letters (places, names, proper names)

   Find words occurrence in text only once (70%)

   Do not use digits to position in True or False and Heading

2. Special names(90%) > special verbs(10%) > special adjectives or adverbs

   adjective closest to the noun

   adjective positional will occasionally use in Heading and Matching

3. Common words, topic words and repeated words in the question are not suitable

### pointing words

the pointing words only appear in True or False, which is the examing point.

Classification

1. the part after `be, can`

2. Degree
   `only, all, est`

3. Compare
   `A B both words`

4. Consistency
   `numbers, time, place`

Tick the number first, then a noun, and read the text at the same time. If don't find any pointing words, choose the verb and the information behind it.

The relationship between positing and pointing words

- the positioning gives the answer location
- the pointing decides the answer

### options note

True / Yes

> The questions stem consistent with the text
>
> The subject words are consistent with the test point words

False / No

> The question is contrary to the text
>
> the subject words are consistent, but the points are contrary

False classification

- The "absolutely" statement may be wrong (80%) 绝对陈述词

  `must/absolutely/definitely/invariably/inevitably/unarguably/assuredly/indisputably/certainly/without question = out of the question`

  `impossible/immediate/always/usually/never/all/every/any/none`

  `both can use in Choice`

  `On the contrary, the "possible" statement may be correct (70%)`

- Antisense 反义

  In the text, the positioning words around is the negative word.

  `not/no longer/not anymore/by not means(never)`

   In the text, the positioning words around the implying negation

   `used to do sth/until recently/as was once the case`

- Single qualification 单一限定

  `In the text, "x and y are...".`

  `In the choice, "Only x is..." (False), "xxx is ..." (True)`

  `In the text, "xxx is ..."`

  `In the choice, "only xxx is ..." (NOT GIVEN)`

- The probability of selecting No among the numbers, but the age and time can't be used. 题干有数字选错概率大

NOT GIVEN

- Not mentioned 没提及

- Pointing words not repeated 考点没出现

- Not have not a comparison 没有对比

- than NG(70%)

- Authority effect, public effect 将观点当成事实

  The text is a person's opinion, the topic stem is an objective statement of fact

- Best 最高级

  text is "one of", the choice is "est" (NG)

  text is "est", the choice is "one of" (True)
